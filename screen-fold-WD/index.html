        This document specifies an API that allows web applications to request the
        angular value to which a device with a screen hinge is folded. Under the
        right conditions, and if allowed, the value representing the angle in
        degrees is returned.

        Implementors need to be aware that this specification is extremely
        unstable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
        discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in
        incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        New types of mobile devices are appearing that have some sort of folding capabilities around the screen. Hence, 
        when the device folds, it physically forms an angle. The main interest in knowing the fold angle is because there
         are opportunities in responsive design that enable new user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>Among the described "folding" devices, there are mainly two different physical form factors: devices with a single
         flexible screen (seamless), and devices with two screens (with seam). They can both fold around a hinge, and the 
         current specification applies to both types. It should be clarified as well that both seamless and (devices) with seam
         can be of different dimension ranging from mobile and tablets to laptop sizes. It should also be noted that different
         devices will have different default orientations (portrait or landscape), and that the fold might happen in a vertical
         or horizontal way.    
      </p>
      <span class="centered">
        <img src="images/form-factors.svg" height="150" alt="drawing of different type of foldable devices">
      </span>
      <p>
        From enhancing the usability of a website by avoiding the area of a fold, to enabling innovative use cases for the 
        web, knowing the fold angle can help developers tailor their content to different devices. It can also enable to 
        detect different postures the device might be in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content can be consumed and browsed even when the device is not flat, in which case the developer might want to
         provide a different layout for it depending on the state of the angle of the fold. Additionally, developers can 
         adapt content depending on various “postures” and potentially also animate some of these transitions. You can 
         refer to a description of use cases.

        Reading the posture
      </h2>
      <p>
        All <a>documents</a> have a <dfn>current screen fold angle</dfn> and a
        <dfn>current posture</dfn>. Both of them SHOULD be
        initialized when the <a>document</a> is created, otherwise they MUST
        be initialized the first time they are accessed and before their
        value is read. The <a>user agent</a> MUST <a>update the screen fold
        information</a> of the <a>document</a> to initialize them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a given <a>document</a>, the <a>current posture</a>
        is derived from the <a>current screen fold angle</a> and the <a>
        current screen orientation</a>.
      </p>
      <p><i>These tables are non-normative.</i></p>
      <h3><dfn>Posture values table</dfn></h3>
      <p>The values are approximations and might differ per device. For instance, a device might not yield exactly 180° when laying flat, but instead values ranging from 175° to 185°. Device makers SHOULD make sure that the physical device postures map correctly to the postures defined by this specification.</p>

        <p>Some devices might also lack one or more of the postures due to physical constraints or device design, in which case the device SHOULD make sure that all combinations of angles and device orientation (which can be locked by [[SCREEN-ORIENTATION]] and host OS) maps into one of the defined postures.</p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/angle-graphic.svg" alt="An illustration on how posture values are derived from the orientation of the fold">
        The <a>posture values table</a> shows how the {{posture}}

      <h2>
        Security and Privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Screen Fold API exposes two kinds of information:
      </p>
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
            an <a href="#the-angle-attribute-get-current-screen-fold-angle">angle</a> value
            representing the hinge position
          </li>
          <li>
            A <a>posture</a> determined from the angle value
          </li>
        </ol>
      <p>
        Typical sensor readings are sent at a constant frequency to whomever is listening to its readings.
        However the fold angle only communicates its value when the hinge is manipulated by the user.
        Variations in the angle’s readings and posture calculation, as well as event dispatching frequency
        offer a possibility of fingerprinting to identify users. User agents may reduce this risk by limiting
        or coalescing events when exposing this information to web developers. Users don’t constantly adjust
        the angle, so the fold angle value is changing in bursts: the events may be dispatched at a very low
        frequency most of the time and fire at a high frequency when the device is being opened or closed.
        In order for the events to be dispatched, the content must be on the foreground and visible to the
        user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Minimizing the accuracy of the angle readout generally decreases the risk of fingerprinting.
        User agents should not provide unnecessarily verbose readouts of the hinge angle data.
        Posture values are not very useful values to fingerprint a user. They’re similar in concept
        with the orientation values. The posture change is only triggered in certain fold angle values
        providing a very low resolution reading. Because the changes are very sparse changes with very
        few predefined values, it makes it hard to precisely identify users across sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the same code using the API can be used simultaneously in different window contexts on the same
        device it may be possible for that code to correlate the user across those two contexts, creating
        unanticipated tracking mechanisms.

            Secure Context
          </h4>
          <p>
            Posture value and fold angle readings are explicitly flagged by the Secure Contexts specification as a
            high-value target for network attackers. Thus all interfaces defined by this specification or extension
            specifications are only available within a secure context.

          <h4>
            Focused Area
          </h4>
          <p>
            Posture value and fold angle readings are only available for active documents whose origin is the
            same origin-domain with the currently focused area document.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is done in order to mitigate the risk of a skimming attack against the browsing context
            containing an element which has gained focus, for example when the user carries out an in-game
            purchase using a third party payment service from within an iframe.

          <h4>
            Limit maximum sampling frequency
          </h4>
          <p>
            User agents may mitigate certain threats by limiting the maximum sampling frequency.
            Coalescing and aligning the fold angle readings with the animation frame would limit
            the fingerprinting while still allowing animations responding to the fold angle. Limiting
            the maximum sampling frequency prevents use cases which rely on low latency or high
            data density.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>
            Limit number of delivered readings
          </h4>
          <p>
            An alternative to limiting the maximum sampling frequency is to limit the number of sensor
            readings delivered to Web application developers, regardless of what frequency the sensor
            is polled at. This allows use cases which have low latency requirements to increase sampling
            frequency without increasing the amount of data provided. Discarding intermediary readings
            prevents certain use cases, such as those relying on certain kinds of filters.
            User agent should wait before sending the angle value changes after a minimum of degrees
            changes to remove the noise as well as to avoid getting events while the user is just
            interacting with the screen. This would limit identifying users with shaky hands.

        <section>
          <h4>
            Reduce accuracy
          </h4>
          <p>
            Lowering the resolution of the angle MAY lead to reducing the uniqueness
            that the value can have. Nonetheless, if several sites are being displayed
            on the same device, it can be easy to identify that it is the same user,
            even if the value is rounded. As a solution, applying some fuzziness to
            the value itself MAY work.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>
            Applying fuzziness to the angle value
          </h3>
          <p>
            Lowering the resolution of the returned value may not be enough, so fuzzing
            out the value can algo help, in order to report different values. This fuzzy
            offset can help differentiate returned values, minimizing the risk of fingerprinting.

        Examples
      </h2>
      <h3>Example 1: screen.fold data</h3>
      <p>This is a simple use case of the <a>posture</a> and <a href="#the-angle-attribute-get-current-screen-fold-angle">angle</a> value being printed on the console. </p>
      <pre class="example js" title="React to poster change">
          screen.fold.addEventListener("change", () => {
            const { angle, posture } = screen.fold;
            console.log(`The current screen angle is ${angle}, which means it is in ${posture} posture!`);
          })
      </pre>
      
      <h3>Example 2: screen-fold-posture</h3>
      <p>The device is being used for a video call web service. It can be folded into the laptop <a>posture</a> to
        enable a hands-free when placed on a surface. The UA detects the posture and the UI is enhanced.
        Similar examples can be drafted for content to adapt to any posture. See the <a href="https://github.com/SamsungInternet/Explainers/blob/master/Foldables/FoldState.md#key-scenarios">explainer</a> for other key scenarios.
      </p>
      <img src="images/example-videocall.svg" alt="An illustration of a video call web service that uses the screen-fold-posture media feature" class="img-example" >
      <pre class="example css" title="Adapting UI to posture">
        @media (screen-fold-posture: laptop) and (spanning: single-fold-horizontal){
          body {
            display: flex;
            flex-flow: column nowrap;
          }

          .videocall-area, .videocall-controls  {
            flex: 1 1 env(fold-bottom);
          }
        }
      </pre>

      <h3>Example 3: screen-fold-angle</h3>
      <p>
        Some scenarios might span outside of the default <a>postures</a> envisioned in this document.
        The screen-fold-angle media feature allows to define a range or threshold for the layout to 
        change. 
      </p>
      <p>As an example, an experience that might require a separate viewing area by user (like a game)
        might find that the default 185° starting angle for the tent posture is too "open" to guarantee
        one user will not see the other user's screen. Using screen-fold-angle the threshold can be 
        defined by the developer.</p>
        <img src="images/example-screen-fold-angle.svg" alt="diagram of an example that uses an angle range to tailor content">
        <pre class="example css" title="Defining angle ranges for content">
          @media (min-screen-fold-angle: 270deg) {
            /*enable custom layout for the app*/ 
          }

        </pre>

      <h3>Example 4 &amp; 5: Animation</h3>
      <p>
        Opening and closing a device might include animations linked to the value of the angle of the fold.
        This allows the creation of content that can mimic the effect of a pop-up book.  
      </p>
      <p>Another example can be mapping the state of the fold of a device to transformations of a DOM element.
        With this approach you could rotate an element based on the value of the angle.</p>
        <img src="images/exampler-animation.svg" alt="diagram of an img element rotating on the center of a webpage">
        <pre class="example js" title="Element animation based on fold value (JS)">
          let fish = document.querySelector('.fish-circle');
          
          ScreenFold.addEventListener('change', function(e) {
            //animation keyframes
            let rotationFish = [
              {transform: `rotate(${e.angle})`, easing: 'ease-out'}
            ];

            fish.animate(rotationFish, 100);
          };
        </pre>
        <pre class="example css" title="Element animation based on fold value (CSS)">
          .fish-circle {
            transform: rotate(env(screen-fold-angle));
          }
        </pre>

        <h3>Example 6: Feature detection of screen-fold-posture media feature</h3>
        <p>
          As one of the valid screen-fold-posture values will always be true, you can use the following
          snippet to detect whether a user agent supports the media feature:
        </p>
        <pre class="example css" title="Feature detect the screen-fold-posture">
          @media (screen-fold-posture) {
            /*The browser supports screen-fold-posture feature*/
          }
        </pre>
