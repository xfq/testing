        Implementors need to be aware that this specification is extremely
        unstable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
        discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in
        incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this
        specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation
        phase should <a href="https://github.com/w3c/device-posture">

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        New types of mobile devices are appearing that have some sort of folding capabilities around the screen. Hence, 
        when the device folds, it physically can be different form factor. The main interest in knowing the posture is to 
        enable new user experiences with responsive design.
      </p>
      <p>Among the described "folding" devices, there are mainly two different physical form factors: devices with a single
         flexible screen (seamless), and devices with two screens (with seam). They can both fold around a hinge, and the 
         current specification applies to both types. It should be clarified as well that both seamless and (devices) with seam
         can be of different dimension ranging from mobile and tablets to laptop sizes. It should also be noted that different
         devices will have different default orientations (portrait or landscape), and that the fold might happen in a vertical
         or horizontal way.
      </p>
      <span class="centered">
        <img src="images/form-factors.svg" height="150" alt="drawing of different type of foldable devices">
      </span>
      <p>
        From enhancing the usability of a website by avoiding the area of a fold, to enabling innovative use cases for the 
        web, knowing the posture can help developers tailor their content to different devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content can be consumed and browsed even when the device is not flat, in which case the developer might want to 
        provide a different layout for it depending on the posture state in which the device is being used.

        Reading the posture
      </h2>
      <p>
        All <a>documents</a> have a <dfn>current posture</dfn>. Both of them SHOULD be
        initialized when the <a>document</a> is created, otherwise they MUST
        be initialized the first time they are accessed and before their
        value is read. The <a>user agent</a> MUST <a>update the device posture
        information</a> of the <a>document</a> to initialize them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a given <a>document</a>, the <a>current posture</a>
        is derived from the current hinge angle and the <a>
        current screen orientation</a>.
      </p>
      <p><i>These tables are non-normative.</i></p>
      <h3><dfn>Posture values table</dfn></h3>
      <p>The values are approximations and might differ per device. For instance, a device might not yield exactly 180¬∞ when laying flat, but instead values ranging from 175¬∞ to 185¬∞. Device makers SHOULD make sure that the physical device postures map correctly to the postures defined by this specification.</p>

        <p>Some devices might also lack one or more of the postures due to physical constraints or device design, in which case the device SHOULD make sure that all combinations of angles and device orientation (which can be locked by [[SCREEN-ORIENTATION]] and host OS) maps into one of the defined postures.</p>

        The <a>posture values table</a> shows how the {{posture}}

        Security and Privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Device Posture API exposes a <a>posture</a> determined from the hinge angle value and other sensors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical sensor readings are sent at a constant frequency to whomever is listening to its readings.
        However the fold angle only communicates its value when the hinge is manipulated by the user.
        Variations in the angle‚Äôs readings and posture calculation, as well as event dispatching frequency
        offer a possibility of fingerprinting to identify users. User agents may reduce this risk by limiting
        or coalescing events when exposing this information to web developers. Users don‚Äôt constantly adjust
        the angle, so the fold angle value is changing in bursts: the events may be dispatched at a very low
        frequency most of the time and fire at a high frequency when the device is being opened or closed.
        In order for the events to be dispatched, the content must be on the foreground and visible to the
        user.Because the API does not directly expose the raw angle values, but a more abstract posture with fewer possible states, 
        fingerprinting possibilities are limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the same code using the API can be used simultaneously in different window contexts on the same
        device it may be possible for that code to correlate the user across those two contexts, creating
        unanticipated tracking mechanisms.

            Secure Context
          </h4>
          <p>
            Posture value readings are explicitly flagged by the Secure Contexts specification as a
            high-value target for network attackers. Thus all interfaces defined by this specification or extension
            specifications are only available within a secure context.

          <h4>
            Focused Area
          </h4>
          <p>
            Posture value readings are only available for active documents whose origin is the
            same origin-domain with the currently focused area document.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is done in order to mitigate the risk of a skimming attack against the browsing context
            containing an element which has gained focus, for example when the user carries out an in-game
            purchase using a third party payment service from within an iframe.

        Examples
      </h2>
      <h3>Example 1: Posture data</h3>
      <p>This is a simple use case of the <a>posture</a> being printed on the console. </p>
      <pre class="example js" title="React to poster change">
          screen.posture.addEventListener("change", () => {
            console.log(`The current posture is: ${screen.posture.type}!`);
          })
      </pre>
      <h3>Example 2: device-posture</h3>
      <p>The device is being used for a video call web service. It can be folded into the laptop <a>posture</a> to
        enable a hands-free when placed on a surface. The UA detects the posture and the UI is enhanced.
        Similar examples can be drafted for content to adapt to any posture. See the <a href="https://github.com/SamsungInternet/Explainers/blob/master/Foldables/FoldState.md#key-scenarios">explainer</a> for other key scenarios.
      </p>
      <img src="images/example-videocall.svg" alt="An illustration of a video call web service that uses the screen-fold-posture media feature" class="img-example" >
      <pre class="example css" title="Adapting UI to posture">
        @media (device-posture: laptop) and (spanning: single-fold-horizontal){
          body {
            display: flex;
            flex-flow: column nowrap;
          }

          .videocall-area, .videocall-controls  {
            flex: 1 1 env(fold-bottom);
          }
        }
      </pre>
        <h3>Example 3: Feature detection of device-posture media feature</h3>
        <p>
          As one of the valid device-posture values will always be true, you can use the following
          snippet to detect whether a user agent supports the media feature:
        </p>
        <pre class="example css" title="Feature detect the device-posture">
          @media (device-posture) {
            /*The browser supports device-posture feature*/
          }
        </pre>
