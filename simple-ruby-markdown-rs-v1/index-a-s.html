## Abstract {#abstract}

A simple set of rules for placement of Ruby text in Japanese typography.

## Status of This Document {#sotd}

This document was initially written in Japanese and translated to English by the [Japanese Writing Technology](https://www.aplab.jp/jwt) Working Group of the [Advanced Publishing Laboratory](https://www.kri.sfc.keio.ac.jp/en/lab/aplab/) of Keio University.

It represents the subjective view of its authors and contributors as to one possible approach to address the problem, and does not claim to be the only possible solution. It is submitted to present a non-Japanese speaking audience with this particular approach, and to encourage discussion of this topic.

The original Japanese version is [available in PDF format](ruby-rules-ja.pdf).

## Purpose of this document {#document_purpose}

Ruby is the name given to the small annotations in Japanese content that are rendered alongside base text, usually to provide a pronunciation guide, but sometimes to provide other information. (See the article [“What is ruby”](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-ruby.en) by the internationalization Working Group for more information.)
